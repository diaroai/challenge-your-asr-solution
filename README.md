# Challenge Your ASR Solution

A curated list of challenging audio files for testing and benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) solutions.

## Project Overview

This project is **not a code repository**, but rather a collection of challenging audio files with their transcriptions. Each folder contains an audio file and transcriptions submitted by different contributors using their automated ASR solutions.

## Project Goals

- **Challenge ASR Solutions**: Provide challenging audio files to test the capabilities of various ASR systems
- **Compare Solutions**: Allow contributors to showcase their automated transcription solutions
- **Build a Benchmark Dataset**: Create a curated collection of challenging audio scenarios

## Important Guidelines

⚠️ **Only automated solutions are accepted** - Manual editing defeats the purpose of this challenge. Please submit only transcriptions generated by your automated ASR solution without any human intervention.

## Folder Structure

Each challenge folder should follow this structure:

```text
challenge-folder-name/
├── audio-file.[mp3|wav|pcm|...]  # The audio file to transcribe
├── README.md                       # Description and contributor table
└── YYYY-MM-DD.transcript          # Transcription files (one per contributor)
```

### README.md Format

Each folder's `README.md` should include:

1. **Description**: Brief information about the audio file
   - Language(s)
   - Domain (e.g., meeting, podcast, interview, etc.)
   - Challenge(s) (e.g., background noise, multiple speakers, accents, etc.)

2. **Contributors Table**: A table mapping contributors to their solutions

Example:

```markdown
## Description

- **Language**: English, Chinese
- **Domain**: Technical meeting
- **Challenge**: Multiple speakers, background noise, technical terminology

## Contributors

| GitHub Username | Solution | Date |
|----------------|----------|------|
| @username1     | Whisper Large-v3 | 2025-01-15 |
| @username2     | Custom ASR Model | 2025-01-16 |
```

### Transcription File Format

- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD.transcript` (e.g., `2025-01-15.transcript`)
- Each contributor should create their own transcription file
- Include your GitHub username in the file (as a comment or header)

## Contributing

### Submitting a Transcription

1. Fork this repository
2. Navigate to the challenge folder you want to contribute to
3. Create a new transcription file: `YYYY-MM-DD.transcript`
4. Add your GitHub username and solution details to the `README.md` contributors table
5. Submit a Pull Request

### Submitting a New Challenge

If you have a challenging audio file that would benefit the community:

1. Create a new folder with a descriptive name
2. Add the audio file
3. Create a `README.md` with the description and empty contributors table
4. Submit a Pull Request
